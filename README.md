<br>
<img src=ds2.png>

Welcome to my submission for Task 2 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I performed Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering on a provided dataset, focusing on preparing the data for predictive modeling.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this task is <a href=test.csv>test_dataset</a>. 

## Tools and Libraries used
- Jupyter notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlip & Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset to ensure the quality of the data.
   
3. **Feature Engineering**: Created new features that might help improve the performance of predictive models. This included:

Normalization and standardization of numerical features.
Encoding categorical variables.
Creation of interaction terms and polynomial features.
Selection of relevant features based on correlation analysis.

3. **Visualization**: Created a bar chart, stacked chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. 



## Conclusion

In conclusion, this EDA process provided valuable insights into the distribution of the selected variable in the dataset. This analysis lays the foundation for further exploration and modeling tasks in the data science workflow.
